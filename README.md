# (work in progress) Fletcher-Munson experiment

This is a web implementation of the Fletcher-Munson equal loudness contour experiment. Tone.js is used to harness the Web Audio API to generate tones of different frequencies and adjust volume levels, while Vue.js is used to ensure full interactivity for the end user.

(Incomplete) demo [here](https://teuncm.github.io/fletcher-munson-web/)!
