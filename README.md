# (work in progress) Fletcher-Munson experiment

This is a web implementation to recreate the [Fletcher-Munson equal loudness contour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour#Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves) experiment. Tone.js is used to harness the Web Audio API to generate tones of different frequencies and adjust volume levels, while Vue.js is used to ensure full interactivity for the end user.

(Incomplete) [demo here](https://teuncm.github.io/fletcher-munson-web/)!
